This is an Investment Portfolio Tracker project developed using frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS & JavaScript. This portfolio tracker monitors our investments, displays the total portfolio value and total investment amount, and allows us to visualize our investment data in a pie chart format.
This Project is basically useful for Traders and Investors.
This project also tracks your individual investments and visualizes them in a pie chart, showing each investment as a percentage.
You can also modify or add new investments.
This project was assigned to me during my internship and successfully, I have completed it.
